1.0 WELCOME TO THE FONT MANAGER
Fonts are resources which help you convey feeling and
meaning in text and presentations. Font Manager helps you
manage your fonts in MS Windows. Because it can handle
TrueType and Postscript Type 1, it provides a single 
comprehensive program which allows you to:
- Install and uninstall fonts in Windows 98, Windows 2000, 
	Windows XP, and Windows Vista 
- Load new fonts from distribution media
- Search your local and network drives for fonts 
- Preview the fonts on your computer or network
- Create font groups for personal or workgroup projects
- Sort your fonts in a variety of ways
- ... and much more!

2.0 MINIMUM SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
MS Windows Version: Windows 98, Windows 2000, Windows XP, or Windows Vista

Only single end-user / workstation versions of Windows are supported. 
No Server versions of Windows are supported.
    
3.0 INSTALLATION
To install the program please insert the CD-Rom into
your CD drive. The Autorun feature is enabled on the CD-ROM.
so the installer should start up automatically after the
CD is inserted.

Otherwise, from the Start Button, select Run 
and type "E:\Setup" and hit ENTER (your CD-Rom drive 
may have a different letter). The installation has online 
Help if you have questions while installing. Once the
program has been installed, double click the program icon to
start the program. Font Manager includes a comprehensive
on-line help system which can be invoked by hitting F1.

4.0 TOOLBAR
The Font Manager has a toolbar to speed your access to
operations. Each icon represents a basic operation. Please
consult the on-line help system for an explanation of each
of the Font Manager toolbar icon functions.

5.0 MENUS
The Font Manager conveniently allows you to access basic
operations through menu picks.

6.0 AVAILABLE FONTS
There are three basic windows displayed in Font Manager. The
first of these is the list of available fonts. It is from
this list that you can select fonts to install in Windows.
You can also select fonts from this list for previewing on
the screen or for obtaining printer samples.

7.0 INSTALLED FONTS
The installed fonts window shows the family name of fonts
which are installed and active under Windows. These fonts
are active under Windows and may be used in Windows
applications.

8.0 FONT GROUPS
Font grouping is a powerful feature of the Font Manager. It
allows you to create custom collections of fonts and give
them meaningful names.

9.0 SCREEN FONTS
Along with the Font Manager, your distribution media also
has a set of TrueType screen fonts to match your new printer.
These TrueType screen fonts have been selected
to give you an excellent WYSIWYG connection between your
Windows applications and your printer. Your printer 
contains these fonts in Monotype Imaging's MicroType
format, a patented, highly compressed font technology.
 
You can elect to install the matching TrueType fonts on your
system when you install the Font Manager program. 
Of course, you are always free to install new fonts 
or to reinstall fonts at a later date.

10.0 FONT MANAGER TIPS

10.1 SEARCHING FOR FONTS
In "Search for Fonts," under the "Select Drives"
feature the Font Manager displays a search window. In this
window you will see a drive type icon, a drive letter, a
drive classification of Local or LAN. Local means the drive
is on your PC, LAN means the drive is on a network server.
The last column displays the drive label. This  label will
either be blank or contain a name that may not be familiar
to you (i.e. - MS-DOS 60). This name is the volume label of
the particular drive recognized by the Windows software. To
begin a Search for Fonts, simply click on the drive(s) you
wish to search and then click the "OK" button.

10.2 FONT GROUPS
Clicking on a Font Group name will highlight and
unhighlight the group name and the fonts contained in that
group. If you double-click on a font name the Preview window
will appear and display that font.

11.0 FONT MANAGER ISSUES

11.1 PROGRAM INSTALLATION ISSUES
11.1.1 In order to install the Font Manager under Windows Vista, 
or the latest version of Windows XP (SP 2), you must be logged in 
with Administrator privileges. As part of the install process, 
the Font Manager installer will change access permissions for 
certain system directories and registry keys (so that the Font 
Manager can be run by a regular non-Administrator user).

11.1.2 As part of the Font Manager install process, an older version 
of a Microsoft Access Database component is installed. This component 
is used exclusively by the Font Manager, to maintain its database of 
installed fonts (an .MDB file). Installing this legacy component will 
not have any effect on the operation of any other version of Access
that is available on your system.

However, you should never open the Font Manager database file 
manually with Microsoft Access, as this might corrupt the Font
Manager database so that it can no longer be used. In particular, if 
you accidentally open the database, then you should not save it. 

11.2 HELP SYSTEM ISSUES
No issues.

11.3 SEARCHING FOR FONTS ISSUES
11.3.1 When a floppy drive is searched and no diskette is
inserted, Font Manager displays an error dialog saying there
is no diskette in the drive. The Font Manager program begins
the requested search when the user has inserted the
appropriate media and clicked "OK" to the error dialog
window.

11.3.2 During a Search for Fonts on either a network, DVD-ROM,
or CD-ROM, clicking on the "Stop" button has no immediate
effect. The best action to take is to keep trying by
clicking the button multiple times.

11.3.3 The Font Manager tries to determine what media (DVD-ROM,
CD-ROM, or floppy disk) is inserted in your PC. You may see
these particular drive lights go on briefly due to this
fact.

11.3.4 During a Network search, for brief moments, the
directory path may disappear when searching certain paths.
Also, when a font is found sometimes just the font name
displays and not the directory path. Please be assured the
Font Manager will return to your control when the search is
complete.

11.3.5 If you use the Edit box to specify the search path
(i.e. you type in the path manually rather than using the
Windows browser), note that the search will always be
case-sensitive. This is true both for OSes that are always
case-sensitive (such as Windows Vista), and for OSes that
are normally case-insensitive (such as Windows XP). If you
are not sure of the case, we recommend that you use the 
Browse feature to specify your search path.

11.4 FONT INSTALLATION ISSUES
11.4.1 The Font Manager does not currently support the 
following formats:
- the MultiMaster variant of Type 1 fonts
- the TrueType Collection format (xxx.TTC)
- the OpenType format (xxx.OTF)
- any bitmap font format
- the Vista CompositeFont format (xxx.CompositeFont)

11.5 FONT UNINSTALLATION ISSUES
11.5.1 The Font Manager and ATM 4.0's "Font Set/Auto Activation"
causes a problem. When Font Manager uninstalls a Type 1 font,
ATM automatically reinstalls it when Windows is restarted. 
This is due to the ATM 4.0 advanced setting called 
"Type 1 Font Controls/Enable Auto-Activation." This feature's
default setting is "ON" and should be turned "OFF."

Note that this is not an issue in Windows Vista, which no longer
uses ATM (Adobe Type Manager) to manage Type 1 fonts.

11.6 REMOVING FONTS ISSUES
No Issues.

11.7 PREVIEWING FONTS ISSUES
11.7.1 The Preview display for some Bold or Italic font
characters are getting clipped on the screen. Try selecting
another smaller point size and the problem usually goes
away.

11.7.2 If you Preview any installed font family with four
styles and select a large point size (i.e. - 200 pt), the
Preview window expands, but is unable to display all the
styles because they scroll off the bottom off the screen.
Simply select another smaller point size until all styles
are visible in the preview window.

11.8 PRINTING FONT SAMPLES ISSUES
No Issues.

11.9 FONT GROUPS ISSUES
No issues.

11.10 GENERAL FONT MANAGER ISSUES
11.10.1 The Font Manager should not be used until the Windows
Font Control Panel is closed.

11.10.2 When the Font Manager program takes a long time to
perform a given operation, the "Fonts Available for
Installation" and "Fonts Installed in Windows" lists 
may disappear for a short time. The windows will return when
the given operation is completed.

11.11 WIN 98 ISSUES
11.11.1 Unicode support for pathnames, filenames, and Preview text 
is not available under Win 98.

11.12 WIN 2000 ISSUES
No issues.

11.13 WIN XP ISSUES
No Issues.

11.14 WIN VISTA ISSUES
No Issues.
