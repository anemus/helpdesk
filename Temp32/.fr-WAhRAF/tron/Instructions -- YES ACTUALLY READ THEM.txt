BACKGROUND:  Why the name? Tron "Fights for the User"

I got tired of running these utilities manually and decided to just automate everything, so Tron basically automates a variety of tasks to clean up/disinfect a Windows machine.

USE:
1. Boot into Safe Mode with Network Support (Safe Mode is not required but is strongly recommended)
2. Copy tron.bat and the \resources folder to the target machine and run tron.bat as an ADMINISTRATOR (Tron does not work if you don't run it as an Administrator)
3. Wait anywhere from 3-10 hours (yes, it really does take that long)
4. Reboot

By default the master log file is at C:\Logs\tron\tron.log. If you want to change this, read the section on changing defaults below.

Tron will briefly check for a newer version when it starts up and notify you if one is found. 

Depending how badly the system is infected, it could take anywhere from 3 to 10 hours to run. I've personally observed times between 4-8 hours, and one user reported a run time of 30 hours. Basically set it and forget it.


COMMAND-LINE USE:
Command-line use is fully supported. All flags are optional and can be combined.*

tron.bat [-a -c -d -e -er -gsl -m -o -p -r -sa -sb -sd -se -sp -sfr -spr -srr -sw -v -x] | [-h]

  -a   Automatic mode (no welcome screen or prompts; implies -e)
  -c   Config dump (display current config. Can be used with other
       flags to see what WOULD happen, but script will never execute
       if this flag is used)
  -d   Dry run (run through script without executing any jobs)
  -e   Accept EULA (suppress disclaimer warning screen)
  -er  Email a report when finished. Requires you to configure SwithMailSettings.xml
  -gsl Generate summary logs. These list exactly what files and programs were removed
  -h   Display help text
  -m   Preserve default Metro apps (don't remove them)
  -np  Skip the pause at the end of script
  -o   Power off after running (overrides -r)
  -p   Preserve power settings (don't reset to Windows default)
  -r   Reboot automatically (auto-reboot 15 seconds after Tron completes)
  -sa  Skip anti-virus scans (MBAM, KVRT, Sophos)
  -sb  Skip de-bloat (OEM bloatware removal; implies -m)
  -sd  Skip defrag (force Tron to ALWAYS skip Stage 5 defrag)
  -se  Skip Event Log clear (don't clear Windows Event Logs)
  -sp  Skip patches (do not patch 7-Zip, Java Runtime, Adobe Flash or Reader)
  -sfr Skip filesystem permissions reset (saves time if you're in a hurry)
  -spr Skip page file reset (don't set to "Let Windows manage the page file")
  -srr Skip registry permissions reset (saves time if you're in a hurry)
  -sw  Skip Windows Updates (do not attempt to run Windows Update)
  -v   Verbose. Show as much output as possible. NOTE: Significantly slower!
  -x   Self-destruct. Tron deletes itself after running and leaves logs intact

 * There is no -UPM flag

 
SCRIPT INTERRUPTION:
If the script is interrupted e.g. from a crash or a forced reboot (often encountered during stage_3_de-bloat), it will attempt to resume from the last stage successfully started. Tron accomplishes this by creating a RunOnce registry key for the current user at the beginning of Stage 0 (e.g. when jobs start executing), and deleting it at the end of the script if everything finished without interruption.
 
More details about this function are in the list of all Tron actions at the bottom of this document.
 

SAFE MODE:
Microsoft, in their long-standing tradition of breaking useful, heavily-used functionality for no reason, changed how to get into Safe Mode for Windows 8, disabling the traditional F8 method. Tron re-enables the F8 method as part of it's prep tasks (before actually running), but here's how to manually re-enable the old-style boot menu that supports the F8 key. From an admin command prompt, run this command:

    bcdedit /set {default} bootmenupolicy legacy
	
Reboot and you should now be able to use F8 to select Safe Mode. Note that this command is the same one Tron runs, so if you launch Tron to the menu and then exit, you'll accomplish the same thing.


EMAIL REPORT:
To have Tron send an email report at completion, edit this file:

    \resources\stage_6_wrap-up\email_report\SwithMailSettings.xml 

Specify your SMTP server, username, and password. After specifying your settings you can use the -er flag to have Tron send the email report. If you used the -gsl flag (generate summary logs) then tron_removed_files.txt and tron_removed_programs.txt will be attached as well.

Keep in mind the username and password for the email account will be stored in PLAIN TEXT so don't leave it lying around on a system you don't trust.


CHANGE DEFAULTS (advanced):
If you don't want to use the command-line and don't like Tron's defaults, you can change the following default variables. Keep in mind command-line flags will always override their respective default option when used.

  - To change the master directory where all of Tron's output goes, edit this line:
       set LOGPATH=%SystemDrive%\Logs\tron

  - To change the name of Tron's master log file, edit this line:
       set LOGFILE=tron.log
  
  - To change where Tron stores quarantined files, change this path (note: this is currently unused by Tron, setting it has no effect):
       set QUARANTINE=%LOGPATH%\quarantine

  - To change the location of the backups Tron makes (Registry, Event Logs, power scheme, etc), edit this line:
       set BACKUPS=%LOGPATH%\backups
  
  - To change where Tron saves raw unprocessed logs from the various sub-tools, edit this line:
       set RAW_LOGS=%LOGPATH%\raw_logs
  
  - To change where Tron saves summary logs (generated if the -gsl flag is used), edit this line:
       set SUMMARY_LOGS=%LOGPATH%\summary_logs

  - To always run automatically (no welcome screen, implies acceptance of EULA), change this to yes:
       set AUTORUN=no

  - To always do a dry run (don't actually execute jobs), change this to yes:
       set DRY_RUN=no
	   
  - To permanently accept the End User License Agreement (suppress display of disclaimer warning screen), change this to yes:
       set EULA_ACCEPTED=no
	   
  - To have Tron send an email report when finished, change this to yes:
       set EMAIL_REPORT=no

  - To have Tron generate summary logs (listing deleted files and removed programs), change this to yes:
       set GENERATE_SUMMARY_LOGS=no
	   
  - To preserve default Metro apps (don't remove them), change this to yes:
       set PRESERVE_METRO_APPS=no
	   
  - To prevent Tron from pausing at the end of the script (waiting for a keypress), change this to yes:
       set NO_PAUSE=yes

  - To shut down the computer when Tron is finished, change this to yes:
       set AUTO_SHUTDOWN=no
	   
  - To preserve the power scheme (instead of resetting to Windows defaults), change this to yes:
       set PRESERVE_POWER_SCHEME=no
  	   
  - To configure post-run reboot, change this value (in seconds). 0 disables auto-reboot:
       set AUTO_REBOOT_DELAY=0

  - To skip anti-virus scan engines (MBAM, KVRT, Sophos), change this to yes:
       set SKIP_ANTIVIRUS_SCANS=no
	   
  - To skip OEM debloat, change this to yes:
       set SKIP_DEBLOAT=no

  - To always skip defrag, regardless whether C:\ is an SSD or not, change this to yes:
       set SKIP_DEFRAG=no

  - To skip Event Log clearing, change this to yes:
       set SKIP_EVENT_LOG_CLEAR=no

  - To skip patches (don't patch 7-Zip, Java, Adobe Flash and Reader) change this to yes:
       set SKIP_PATCHES=no

  - To prevent Tron from granting the SYSTEM and Administrator accounts full permissions to everything under the %WinDir% directory structure, change this to yes:
       set SKIP_FILEPERMS_RESET=no
   
  - To prevent Tron from resetting the page file to Windows defaults, change this to `yes`:
       set SKIP_PAGEFILE_RESET=no
	   
  - To prevent Tron from granting the SYSTEM and Administrator accounts full permissions to the HKLM, HKCU, and HKCR hives, change this to yes:
       set SKIP_REGPERMS_RESET=no
	   
  - To skip Windows Updates (don't attempt to run Windows Update) change this to yes:
       set SKIP_WINDOWS_UPDATES=no

  - To display as much output as possible (verbose), change this to yes:
       set VERBOSE=no
	   
  - To have Tron delete itself after running (self-destruct), change this to yes:
       set SELF_DESTRUCT=no


INTEGRITY:
In every release 'checksums.txt' is signed with my PGP key (0x07d1490f82a211a2, included). You can use it to verify package integrity.
	   
LICENSE:
Tron and any included subscripts and .reg files I've written are free to use/redistribute/whatever under the MIT license. It'd be nice if you sent an email and let me know if you do something cool with it, but it's not required. Any of the sub-tools Tron calls (TDSSK, MBAM, etc) are bound by their respective licenses. It is YOUR responsibility to determine if you can use them in your specific situation.
	   
OTHER:
I try to keep everything updated. If you notice some of the packages are out of date, PM me on reddit or send me an email (listed above), I respond pretty quickly most days.

Hope this is helpful to other PC techs,

#########################
# FULL TRON DESCRIPTION #
#########################
The best way to see what Tron does is simply to crack open Tron.bat with a text editor (preferably one with syntax highlighting) or on Github and just read the code. Every section has comments explaining exactly what it does, and you don't need to be able to read code to understand it. However, barring that, here's a general description of every action Tron performs.

tron.bat                         Master script that launches all other tools. It performs a lot of actions on its own, but for any task we can't perform directly, we call an external utility or script

Tron-internal prep jobs:
(These are all executed even if Tron is canceled before running)
 . Detect Windows version        Determines quite a few things in the script, such as which versions of various commands get executed
 . Detect SSD                    Detect solid state hard drives. If found, tron skips the Stage 5 defrag
 . Detect free space             Detect and save available hard drive space to compare against later. Simply used to show how much space was reclaimed; does not affect any script functions
 . Detect resume                 Detect whether or not we're resuming after an interrupted run (e.g. from a reboot)
 . Enable F8 Safe Mode selection Re-enable the ability to use the F8 key on bootup (Windows 8/8.1 only; enabled by default on Server 2012/2012 R2)
 . Check for update              Use wget to pull down sha256sums.txt from the Tron mirror and see if we're on the current version. Tron will ask to automatically download the newest version. If you answer yes, it will download a copy to the desktop, verify the SHA256 hash, and then self-destruct the current copy
 . Detect Administrator rights   Detect whether or not we're running as Administrator and alert the user if we're not
 . Detect Safe Mode              Detect whether or not we're in Safe Mode and notifies the user if we're not
 . Make log directories          Create the master log directory and sub-directories if they don't exist

STAGE 0: Prep
 . Create RunOnce entry          Create the following registry key to support resuming if there is an interruption: HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce /v "tron_resume" /t REG_SZ /d "%~dp0tron.bat %-resume"
 . Create System Restore point   Windows Vista and up only; client OS's only (not supported on Server OS's). Tron creates a system restore snapshot before beginning operations
 . Rkill                         rkill is an anti-malware prep tool; it looks for and kills a number of known malware that interfere with removal tools. Rkill will exclude any process listed in \resources\stage_0_prep\rkill\rkill_process_whitelist.txt from being closed
 . ProcessKiller                 Utility provided by /u/cuddlychops06 which kills various userland processes. We use this to further kill anything that might interfere with Tron. Specifically, it kills everything in userland with the exception of the following processes: ClassicShellService.exe, explorer.exe, dwm.exe, cmd.exe, mbam.exe, teamviewer.exe, TeamViewer_Service.exe, Taskmgr.exe, Teamviewer_Desktop.exe, MsMpEng.exe, tv_w32.exe, VTTimer.exe, Tron.bat, rkill.exe, rkill64.exe, rkill.com, rkill64.com, conhost.exe, dashost.exe, wget.exe
 . Safe Mode                     Set system to reboot into Safe Mode with Networking if a reboot occurs. Removes this and resets to normal bootup at the end of the script. Accomplished via this command: bcdedit /set {default} safeboot network
 . Set system time via NTP       Sync the system clock to time.nist.gov, 3.pool.ntp.org and time.windows.com
 . McAfee Stinger                anti-malware/rootkit/virus standalone scanner from McAfee. Does not support plain-text logs so we save its HTML log to %LOGPATH%\tron_raw_logs (by default). Tron executes Stinger as follows: stinger32.exe --GO --SILENT --PROGRAM --REPORTPATH="%LOGPATH%" --RPTALL --DELETE
 . TDSS Killer                   anti-rootkit utility from Kaspersky Labs. Tron executes TDSSKiller as follows: tdsskiller.exe -l %TEMP%\tdsskiller.log -silent -tdlfs -dcexact -accepteula -accepteulaksn
 . erunt                         used to backup the registry before beginning a Tron run
 . VSS purge                     purges oldest set of Volume Shadow Service files (basically snapshot-in-time copies of files). Malware can often hide out here.
 . Reduce system restore space   Restrict System Restore to only use 7% of available hard drive space
 . Disable sleep mode            Tron disables sleep mode when the script starts to prevent going to sleep. At the end of the script it resets power settings to Windows defaults, unless you run with the -p flag
 . check and repair WMI          Check the WMI interface and attempt repair if broken. Tron uses WMI for a lot of stuff including ISO date format conversion, OEM bloatware removal, and various other things, so having it functioning is critical
 
STAGE 1: Tempclean
 . Internet Explorer cleanup     Runs built-in Windows tool to clean and reset Internet Explorer ( rundll32.exe inetcpl.cpl,ClearMyTracksByProcess 4351 )
 . TempFileCleanup.bat           Script I wrote to clean some areas that other tools seem to miss. Note: it specifically targets, among other things, any .txt or .bat files at the root of C:\
 . CCLeaner                      CCLeaner utility by Piriform. Used to clean temp files before running AV scanners
 . BleachBit                     BleachBit utility. Used to clean temp files before running AV scanners
 . USB Device cleanup            Cleans unused/not present USB device drivers. Uses drivecleanup.exe from Uwe Sieber ( www.uwe-sieber.de )
 . Clear Windows event logs      Backs up Windows event logs to the LOGPATH directory, then clears all log files
 . Clear Windows Update cache    Purges uninstaller files for already-installed Windows Updates. Typically frees up quite a bit of space

STAGE 2: De-bloat, programs specified in: \resources\stage_3_de-bloat\programs_to_target_by_name.txt
 . OEM de-bloat (by name)        Use WMI to attempt to uninstall any program listed in this file:  \resources\stage_3_de-bloat\oem\programs_to_target_by_name.txt
 . OEM de-bloat (by GUID)        Use WMI to attempt to remove specific list of GUIDs in this file: \resources\stage_3_de-bloat\oem\programs_to_target_by_GUID.bat
 . Metro de-bloat                Remove built-in Metro apps that no one uses (programs like Calculator, Paint etc are NOT removed). Purges them from the cache (can always fetch from Windows Update later).

STAGE 3: Disinfect
 . RogueKiller                   anti-rootkit utility and anti-malware prep tool. Similar to rkill
 . Malwarebytes Anti-Malware     Anti-malware scanner. Because there is no command-line support for MBAM, we simply install it and continue with the rest of the script. This way a tech can click "scan" whenever they're around, but the script doesn't stall while waiting for user input. Using Tron's -sa flag skips this component
 . Kaspersky Virus Removal Tool  Command-line anti-virus scanner. Using Tron's -sa flag skips this component
 . Sophos Virus Removal Tool     Command-line anti-virus scanner. Using Tron's -v flag gives more verbose output. Using Tron's -sa flag skips this component
 . DISM image check & repair     Microsoft utility for checking the Windows Image Store (basically like System File Checker on crack). Windows 8 and up only

STAGE 4: Repair
 . Registry permissions reset    Grant SYSTEM and Administrator users full permissions on HKLM, HKCU, and HKCR hives. This is an add-only permissions operation (does not remove any permissions). Using Tron's -srr flag skips this operation
 . Filesystem permissions reset  Grant SYSTEM and Administrator users full permissions on everything in the %WinDir% directory tree. Using Tron's -sfr flag skips this operation
 . System File Checker           Microsoft utility for checking the filesystem for errors and attempting to repair if found. Tron runs this on Windows Vista and up only (XP and below require a reboot) 
 . chkdsk                        Checks disk for errors and schedules a chkdsk with repair at next reboot

STAGE 5: Patch                   Tron installs or updates these programs:
 . 7-zip                         Open-source compression and extraction tool. Far superior to just about everything (including the venerable WinRAR). Using Tron's -sp flag skips this component
 . Adobe Flash Player            Used by YouTube and various other sites. Using Tron's -sp flag skips this component
 . Adobe Reader                  Standard PDF reader. Using Tron's -sp flag skips this component
 . Java Runtime Environment      I hate Java, but it is still widely used so we at least get the system on the latest version. Using Tron's -sp flag skips this component
 . Windows updates               Self-explanatory
 . DISM base reset               Recompile the "Windows Image Store" after we finished purging old files from it earlier. Windows 8 and up only

STAGE 6: Optimize
 . Page file reset               Reset the system page file settings to "let Windows manage the page file." Accomplished via this command: %WMIC% computersystem where name="%computername%" set AutomaticManagedPagefile=True. Using Tron's -spr flag skips this action
 . Defraggler                    Command-line defrag tool from Piriform that's a little faster than the built-in Windows defragmenter

STAGE 7: Wrap-up
 . email_report                  Sends an email report with log file when Tron finishes. Requires you to specify your SMTP settings in \resources\stage_6_wrap-up\email_report\SwithMailSettings.xml
 . generate summary logs         If selected with -gsr flag or GENERATE_SUMMARY_LOGS variable, Tron will generate before and after logs detailing which files were deleted and which programs were removed. These are placed in LOGPATH\tron_summary_logs. Additionally, if -er flag was used or EMAIL_REPORT variable was set, these logs will be attached to the email that is sent out
 
STAGE 8: Manual tools            Tron does not run these automatically because most of them don't support command-line use, or are only useful in special cases
 . ADSSpy                        Scan for hidden NTFS Alternate Data Streams
 . AdwCleaner                    Popular user-suggested adware removal tool
 . aswMBR                        Rootkit scanner
 . autoruns                      Examine and remove programs that run at startup
 . ComboFix                      The "scorched-earth policy" of malware removal
 . PCHunter                      Tool to scan for rootkits and other malicious items. Replaces gmer
 . Junkware Removal Tool         Temp files and random junkware remover
 . Net Adapter Repair            Utility to repair most aspects of Windows network connections
 . ServicesRepair.exe            ESET utility for fixing broken Windows services
 . TempFileCleaner               OldTimer utility for cleaning temp files
 . UserBenchMark.exe             Quick automatic system benchmark utility, compares the system to an online database of similar systems
 . VirusTotal uploader tool      Uploads a file directly to VirusTotal for scanning
